<h2> Joystick Joyride </h2>
Tournament Edition

<h2>Description</h2>
I effectively made a projectile dodging game, and made it networked. That's all it really is, which is a very simple idea, but not so much in terms of the code required.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
This takes me back to the days, when I was working on my first project. I initially planned to create a sword throwing game using vectors of the mouse relative to a specific point, which soon after I ended up forgetting to set a specific vector and instead had the projectile (which was at the time a little red dot) moving relative to my mouse, and thus my movement code was born. After that, I went on and made a game around it which involved projectiles flying at you and dodging them, similar to my game.
